#JLogg

JLogg is a JavaFX based port of [glogg](https://glogg.bonnefon.org/)
In essence it's a log file searching tool made for searching in large log files.

##Features
- [x] Searching in the log files (using ctrl/command+F) 
- [x] Highlighting lines in the log file using regular expressions (using ctrl/command+H) 
- [ ] Make it possible to have custom plugins to make it easier to investigate your log files

##Installation 
###Windows
On windows it's just as easy as downloading the msi of one of the releases and running the msi. 

###MacOS
On apple devices, you'll have to disable the quaratine flag before installing the dmg (using: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine path_to_file). 
I'm not part of the apple developer program nor do I have the intention to sign up for this app.
